Incident Report – Windows Failed Login Monitoring
1. Incident Summary

Multiple failed interactive logon attempts were detected on a Windows endpoint within a short time window. The events indicate repeated authentication failures originating from the local system, which may suggest brute-force behavior, misconfigured services, or automated authentication attempts.

2. Detection Details

Event ID: 4625 (An account failed to log on)

Log Source: Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing

Keywords: Audit Failure

Logon Type: 2 (Interactive)

Authentication Package: Negotiate

Logon Process: User32

Caller Process: C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe

3. Timeline of Events
Date & Time	Event ID	Source IP	Logon Type
12/24/2025 09:57:39	4625	127.0.0.1	Interactive
12/24/2025 09:57:43	4625	127.0.0.1	Interactive
12/24/2025 09:57:48	4625	127.0.0.1	Interactive
12/24/2025 09:57:51	4625	127.0.0.1	Interactive

Observation:
Four failed login attempts occurred within 12 seconds, indicating rapid authentication retries.

4. Affected Account Information

Target Account Name: - (NULL SID)

Account Domain: -

Initiating Account: DESKTOP-BH679AG$

Security ID: SYSTEM

Note:
The absence of a valid target account suggests the attempts may be generated by a system process rather than a specific user account.

5. Network & Process Analysis

Source Network Address: 127.0.0.1 (localhost)

Source Port: 0

Workstation Name: Not available

Caller Process ID: 0x4d8

Caller Process Name: svchost.exe

Assessment:
The authentication failures originated locally, indicating either:

A misconfigured service

A background system process retrying authentication

A simulated attack scenario in a lab environment

6. Failure Reason Analysis

Failure Reason: An error occurred during logon

Status Code: 0xC000006D (Bad username or authentication information)

Sub Status: 0xC0000380

These status codes are commonly associated with authentication failures and are consistent with brute-force or repeated login attempts.

7. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Tactic: Credential Access

Technique: T1110 – Brute Force

Although the source IP is localhost, the behavior matches brute-force characteristics due to rapid repeated failures.

8. Severity Assessment

Severity Level: Low (Lab Environment)

Confidence: Medium

Reason:

No successful login observed

Localhost source

Controlled testing environment

9. Recommended Remediation Actions

Review services running under svchost.exe

Ensure no misconfigured authentication loops exist

Apply account lockout policies

Monitor for transition from failures (4625) to success (4624)

Educate users on secure authentication practices

10. Lessons Learned

Rapid failed login attempts can be detected using simple threshold-based logic

Even localhost events require investigation in real SOC environments

Understanding Event ID 4625 fields is critical for accurate triage

11. Conclusion

This incident demonstrates effective detection of failed authentication attempts using Windows Security logs. The project successfully simulates SOC-level monitoring, analysis, and documentation workflows using real Windows event data.
